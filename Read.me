Extension of this project:

Static class for those which don't require any state (TurnLeft, TurnRight, Move)
Make ParseCommand methods (processGrid,parseCommand,processPosition) to implement InteractionCommand interface
Make error management for input (currently there's no error checking for wrong formatted instructions)
It's made by windows. Beware of linux compatibility
