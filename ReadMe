README :

## Run

- Go to Main class : **MoveRobotFromFile**
- Edit file path (use \resource\inputFile.txt as an example). Path **is relative** to the project root


## Extension of this project:

- Static class for those which don't require any state (TurnLeft, TurnRight, Move)
- Make ParseCommand methods (processGrid,parseCommand,processPosition) to implement InteractionCommand interface
- Make error management for input (currently there's no error checking for wrong formatted instructions)
- Make ParseInstructions cleaner, alowwing to detect blocks of instructions in a better way
- Make commandLine reader
- Inject commands "turnLeft, turnRight, moveRobot" to Robot class dynamically instead of calling them inside the constructor (It would decouple the
    class from its behavior a little bit more, but I've chosen the current way for readability purposes)
- It's made by windows. Beware of linux compatibility
